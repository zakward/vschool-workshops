What is React?

React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces in web applications. It simplifies the process of creating dynamic and responsive UIs by allowing developers to create reusable components that update efficiently when the underlying data changes. React follows a component-based architecture, making it popular for building modern, interactive web interfaces.

What is State?

State, in contrast, refers to the internal data that a component can manage and manipulate. It represents the dynamic aspect of a component, enabling it to maintain and respond to changes over time. State is used to update and control a component's behavior and appearance in response to user interactions or other events.

What is Props?

Think of "props" in React like passing notes from one friend to another. You give your friend important information or instructions that they need to know. In React, components can also give information to each other using props.

"State" is like a backpack a character carries in a video game. It holds the things that can change while playing. In React, components have a backpack too â€“ it's the state. It's where a component keeps track of things that might be different as you interact with it, like a game character's health or score.

What is Vite?

Vite is a build tool and development server that offers a rapid development experience for web applications, including React. It utilizes native ES modules to achieve fast loading times during development and optimizes the production build process.
With Vite, developers can enjoy instant server starts, efficient hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized bundles for deployment. Integrating Vite with React involves setting up a Vite project, building React components, and utilizing Vite's development and production modes for enhanced efficiency.
