# Workshop Plan: Introduction to Loops and Conditionals

## Overview:
In this workshop, we will explore the fundamentals of using loops and conditionals in JavaScript to create efficient and dynamic code. Loops allow us to handle repetitive tasks, and conditionals help us make decisions based on different conditions within the code.

## Agenda:

### 1. Introduction to Loops:
- Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, optimizing repetitive tasks.
- JavaScript has two primary types of loops: the `while` loop and the `for` loop.
- The `while` loop executes a code block as long as a given condition is true.
- The `for` loop provides a way to repeat a code block for a specific number of iterations.

### 2. Using Loops for Data Processing:
- Loops are helpful for processing data, such as iterating through arrays to perform operations on each element.
- We will examine an example of calculating the sum of all numbers in an array using a loop.

### 3. Searching and Filtering with Loops:
- Loops can search for specific elements in an array or filter elements based on certain conditions.
- We'll demonstrate finding the first even number in an array using a loop.

### 4. Combining Loops with Conditional Statements:
- We will see how to use conditional statements (e.g., `if`) inside loops to make decisions based on different conditions within the loop.
- An example from an RPG game using `readline-sync` will illustrate this concept.

### 5. Handling Infinite Loops:
- We will define what an infinite loop is and why it should be avoided in programming.
- An example of an infinite loop will be shown, along with an explanation of how to break out of it.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this workshop aims to equip you with a foundational understanding of loops and conditionals in JavaScript. Remember that practice is essential, and experimenting with these concepts in your projects will reinforce your learning.
